## Wargames
* Don't leave them to the last minute, you'll be sad :(

* **Flag != full marks**, you need to submit:
    * The script you used to get it
    * An explanation: your process/the vulnerability

* You probably won't get all the flags

* Cool to collaborate/work together, but your flags and scripts/explanations need to be different.
