## Good faith policy

We expect a high standard of professionalism from you at all times while you are taking any of our courses. We expect all students to act in good faith at all times

*TLDR: Don't be a ~~dick~~ jerk*

### Programming? in my security??
* Last week: jumping to a win() function
* This week: there's no win(), what do?

## Lecture content
* Stack frames (again)
* Harder reverse engineering
* Shellcode

---

## Stack frames (again)
```
    0x18  [  ARGS  ] <- Parameters
    0x14  [  EIP   ] <- Stored Return Pointer
    0x10  [  EBP   ] <- Stored Frame Pointer
    0x0C  [  AAAA  ] <- these are local vars
    0x08  [  AAAA  ]
    0x04  [  AAAA  ]
    0x00  [  AAAA  ]
```

## Harder re
![](/img/week03/operation_implications.png)

## Harder re #2
* what's differs between the instructions below?
```
    mov eax, dword ptr [esp]
    mov eax, word ptr [esp]
    mov eax, byte ptr [esp]
    mov ax, [esp]
    mov al, [esp]
```

## 🐚 Shellcode
* Q: What is a win() function (or any function)?

---

## 🐚 Shellcode
* Q: What is a win() function (or any function)?
* A: It's just a sequence of assembly instructions

---

## 🐚 Shellcode
* Q: What is a win() function (or any function)?
* A: It's just a sequence of assembly instructions
    * Assembly is just bytes

---

## 🐚 Shellcode
* Q: What is a win() function (or any function)?
* A: It's just a sequence of assembly instructions
    * Assembly is just bytes
    * Bytes is just data (which we can send)

---

## 🐚 Shellcode
* Q: What is a win() function (or any function)?
* A: It's just a sequence of assembly instructions
    * Assembly is just bytes
    * Bytes is just data (which we can send)
* Hence if we can write some assembly instructions, and point EIP at them, we can  get code execution (e.g. read/write, pop a shell)!

## Some helpful instructions :)
hopefully you've seen them in 1521/MIPS?
```
    mov a, b        # a = b
    add a, value    # a += value
    sub a, value    # a -= value
    xor a, b        # a ^= b
    and a, b        # a &= b
    push a          # push a onto stack, dec esp - 4
    pop a           # pop into a from stack, add esp + 4
    int 0x80        # syscall
```

## 🥚 Egghunter
Shellcode is bytes. What if there isn't enough space for a meaningful payload in an overflowable buffer?
* If we have a big non-overflowable buffer, we can store the payload there (and an egg).
* Then in our overflowable buffer, we put a small payload which will search for/execute the egg.

---

## 🍳 Omelette egghunter
What if we don't have a buffer big enough for the entire payload?
* If we have a number of small buffers
    * we use our egghunter to find each of those eggs.
    * chain their execution, to execute our full payload.
